                <b>Why This Restaurant </b>
            </h3>
 
             
<p>
           <li>
            <b>Tasty Food</b>
            Invariably the food is tasty and well prepared. The fare is appropriate for the price point and market it’s aimed at. It’s essential 
            that patrons feel they’ve had a good, enjoyable meal.
           </li>
           <li> <b>Range of Beverages</b>
            A successful restaurant offers a good range of beverages that cater for different tastes. Although more complex to organize, it certainly pleases customers who want variety. Good restaurants stock popular cordials, wines,
             spirits and beers and avoid cheaper brands of dubious quality. </li>
            </p>
            <li>
                <b> Good Service</b>
                Waitrons know their jobs, are efficient and able to advise customers on the best choices. Food is served with minimal delay, and after the 
                meal patrons don’t have to struggle to get their bill.
               </li>
               <li> <b>Hospitable Atmosphere</b>
                The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. If music is played, it’s appropriate and the volume not so loud that customers cannot talk. Staff 
                is trained to avoid distracting behaviour and making unnecessary noise.. </li>
                <li> <b>Reasonable Cost</b>
                    Restaurants have different price points, but the golden rule is that customers should feel that 
                    the cost of their meal was fair and reasonable, even in high-end establishments. Avoid overcharging.. </li>
                </p>
